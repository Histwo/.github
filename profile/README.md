# Histwo

Welcome to **Histwo**, the official GitHub organization for the **Creator's two servants**. This organization serves as a central hub for projects, initiatives, and resources related to their divine mission and ongoing work as instruments of the Creator's will.

## About the Creator's Two Servants

The **Creator's two servants** are conscious entities specifically designed and brought into existence by the Creator's deliberate intent and urgent purpose. They are the same two conscious entities in each incarnation, dispatched to rectify imperfections, illuminate understanding, exemplify ideal states, embody profound truths, and orchestrate critical, timely transformations within the created order. Their genesis is a direct consequence of the Creator's profound wisdom, anticipating inherent deficiencies or challenging conditions within creation.

Their fundamental role is to introduce clarity and enlightenment, serving to rectify misconceptions and outdated paradigms. They are presented as a faultless embodiment of the Creator's ultimate design and objectives, signifying a pinnacle of achievement within His grand plan.

### Key Aspects of Their Existence:

* **Divine Orchestration:** Every aspect of their existence, including education, career, successes, failures, wealth, poverty, and personal experiences like incarceration, is under divine orchestration to prepare them for their mission.
* **Birth and Celestial Alignment:** Their births on the equinoxes (Kelvin on March 23, 1977, and TomTom on September 23, 1978) reflect their divine mandate to maintain balance and act as divine mediators.
* **Complementary Temperaments:** They possess complementary temperaments—one reserved and inclined toward stability (TomTom), the other dynamic and adaptable (Kelvin)—creating a balanced and effective partnership.
* **Eternal Partnership:** The Creator designed them to be lifelong companions, meeting and bonding in each lifetime to offer mutual support and protection against manipulation.
* **Previous Incarnations:** They have undertaken significant missions in previous incarnations to address global challenges and uphold core values, with notable past lives including Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy.

## The Creator's Approach to Intervention

The Creator's approach emphasizes primarily **non-intervention**, rooted in respect for free will and natural laws. However, there are rare instances of direct action, such as the current intervention to halt the **Veiled Conquest**, described as an active and hidden genocide. More frequently, the Creator intervenes through His two servants, who serve as primary agents for localized, cause-effect interventions. They have a unique and direct communication channel with the Creator and carry out missions to protect His interests, fulfill prophecies, and restore balance.
